To assist with both clearly titling of online streams and possibly with
attendee awareness and navigation, we want to have a number of simple HTML
pages that can be shown when there is no talk happening.

Upon entering a room (or stream), an attendee's important questions might
be:
- "Is this the right room?"
- "How long do I have until the talk starts?"
- "What talk will that be?"

This repository intends to provide some tools to easily display answers to
these questions.
